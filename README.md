# THFO Role
 


## Installation

This is a must have plugin, so, use at it as a mu-plugin.
Since this is a folder, you must use a MU Loader and I know of no better than this one : https://github.com/BeAPI/wp-mu-loader.

### via Composer

1. Add a line to your repositories array: `{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/sebastienserre/thfo-role" }`
2. Add a line to your require block: `"sebastienserre/thfo-role"`
3. Run: `composer update`

### Manual

1. Copy the plugin folder into your must use plugins folder.

# THFO Role
 


## Installation

This is a must have plugin, so, use at it as a mu-plugin.
Since this is a folder, you must use a MU Loader and I know of no better than this one : https://github.com/BeAPI/wp-mu-loader.
You can also just copy thfo-role.php in your `/wp-content/mu-plugins` folder.

### via Composer

1. Add a line to your repositories array: `{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/sebastienserre/thfo-role" }`
2. Add a line to your require block: `"sebastienserre/thfo-role"`
3. Run: `composer update`

### Manual

1. copy thfo-role.php in your `/wp-content/mu-plugins` folder

2. **Define PHP Constants** to create your own role.
